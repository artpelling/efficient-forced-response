This repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the results and figures in [[1]](#1).

The input data are taken from the Aachen Multi-Channel Impulse Response Database (MIRD)[[2]](#2) and can be downloaded [here](https://www.iks.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/forschung/tools-downloads/Impulse_response_Acoustic_Lab_Bar-Ilan_University__Reverberation_0.160s__3-3-3-8-3-3-3.zip "MIRD Database").

The archive has to be extracted into "./data/MIRD/" in order to be loaded correctly.
